## Overview

Wikis are available in Synapse projects to provide a space to build narrative content to describe the research. 
Every project has a Wiki tab where you can build pages and a hierarchy of subpages as you would with any website. These pages can be reordered through the Edit Order button below the Wiki pages. Wikis can also be added to folders and files allowing additional content documentation. Wikis, whether they are under the Wiki tab or on a folder, are built in the same way and enables incorporation of highly customized content including, but not limited to: images, tables, code blocks, LaTeX formatted equations, and scholarly references. In addition, Synapse-specific widgets lets you embed dynamic content based on other resources stored in Synapse. 

## Starting, editing and deleting a Wiki


### Using the Synapse web portal
After creating a new project select the Wiki tab. Start a Wiki through the Tools menu by selecting the `Edit Project Wiki` function. Content in this first Wiki becomes your projects home page. Go to the Tools menu to add subpages to your Wiki. These will appear as links on the left side of your home page (Image?). Adding a wiki to a folder or file is done in a similar manner by selecting 'Edit Folder/File Wiki'. Content added to a Wiki can be Previewed before Saving. Each version of a saved Wiki is visible under Wiki History where older versions can be restored. To delete a Wiki select 'Delete Wiki Page' under Tools.  

### Using R/Python (need someone to complete this)
{% tabs %} {% tab Command %}

{% highlight bash %} 
The command line client does not support the creation of Wiki content. We suggest using (to get to the webpage of the project) synapse onweb syn### where syn### is the Synapse Id of your created project. Then editing the Wiki using the web client. {% endhighlight %} {% endtab %}

{% tab Python %} {% highlight python %}
projWiki = Wiki(title='Data Summary', owner = myProj ) markdown = '''* Cell growth look normally distributed
There is evidence of inverse growth between these two cell lines ''' projWiki['markdown'] = markdown projWiki = syn.store(projWiki) 
{% endhighlight %} {% endtab %}

{% tab R %} {% highlight r %} library(synapseClient); 
placeholderText <- "* Cell growth look normally distributed\n* There is evidence of inverse growth between these two cell lines." wiki <- WikiPage(owner=myProject, title="Analysis summary", markdown=placeholderText) wiki <- synStore(wiki) 
{%endhighlight %} {% endtab %}

{% tab Web %} Select **Tools** then select **Edit Project/Folder/File wiki** {% endtab %}

{% endtabs %}

## Governance
Access Controls are not available for Wiki pages. Protected human data should therefore not be shared through Wikis unless it is embedded content stored in Synapse, such as files and tables, that have the appropriate access controls in place. Only people with the appropriate access permission will be able to see the embedded content. See the Synapse Data Use Procedure document for [details](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.synapse.org/governance/SageBionetworksSynapseTermsandConditionsofUse.pdf?v=4).

## Wiki Features

### Markdown language
The layout and text of a Wiki can be customized using Wiki markdown language. A Formatting Guide is available within the Wiki editing window. For additional markdown functions see (need link). Useful markdown shortcuts are available as separate tools, including: heading, bold, italic, strike-through, code block, sub and supescript. 

### Attachments, links and tagging
Files, images and videos can be attached to a Wiki. This may be content on from the web, your desktop, or files already uploaded to Synapse. Links can be added to content available from any source with a url or to a Synapse users profile through the Tag someone widget, or by typing @ - just enter the Synapse username in the dialog that appears.

### Additional Widgets
See the 'Insert' list for the following widgets to customize your Wiki design. 

{% include tip.html content="To edit widgets after they have been added to the wiki, see the widget edit button in the upper left hand corner of the Wiki editing window." %}

* References
Create a reference list by linking to papers using the References widget

* File Preview
Embeds a preview window for csv, txt and image files

* Provenance graph
Embeds the provenance graph created for a file

* Lists and Tables
  * Table of Contents
  Creates a content list that links to sections of the wiki based on headers and subheaders.
  * Entity List
  A list of Synapse folders, files or tables can be easily created by browsing to the Synapse location or searching by entity name or Synapse ID. The table lists entity name, date entity was created, who created it, and for files and tables - version and version notes
  * Table: Paste tabular data
  A table can be created of any data by pasting tab delimited content into this widget window. Tip: add this markdown below the header to enable sort on the header columns.

    ````
     Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3

You can add a [Biodalliance genome browser](http://www.biodalliance.org) using tracks from files uploaded to Synapse or from external sources. Choose between Human or Mouse and adjust your tracks for height and color. See the Biodalliance Setup page for [more information](https://www.synapse.org/#!StandaloneWiki:GenomeBrowser).
